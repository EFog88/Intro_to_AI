Naive Bayes is a very simple but powerful algorithm used for prediction as well as classification. It aims to find target variable probabilty given the probabilities of features. It is very fast algorithm that can predict results (with high accuracy) even for small datasets, thus it can be used over real-time data to make predictions.

Naive Bayes Applications<br />
1) Real-time prediction 
2) Spam Filtering 
3) Weather Forecast 
4) Medical Diagnosis <br />
We will follow these steps in this example <br />
1)In this example we will use Naive bayes Alogorithm to Spam Filtering over spam email dataset.<br /><br />

2)We will try to train our model to recognize spam emails from the dataset.<br /><br />

3)Machine Learning models Only understand numbers, We will look into technioques that can be used to transform textual data into numbers.<br /><br />

4)We will test our trained model and evaluate the accuracy!<br /><br />
